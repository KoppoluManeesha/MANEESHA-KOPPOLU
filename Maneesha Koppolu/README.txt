Python Class-Based Calculator
Project Overview

This project is a simple functional Calculator Program written in Python using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
The calculator takes two numbers and an operation type from the user and performs:

➕ Addition

➖ Subtraction

✖️ Multiplication

➗ Division (with zero-check protection)

Project Features

. Built using Python Classes
. User-friendly input prompts
. Handles errors (ex: division by zero)
. Case-insensitive operations (Add, ADD, add all work)
. Clean and readable code

How It Works

The user enters two numbers → a and b
The user specifies an operation → add, sub, mul, div
The class caliculator processes the operation
The result is displayed on the screen

Example Run

Input:
Enter the a value : 12
Enter the b value : 4
Enter the operation you like to perform : div

Output:
Result 3.0
